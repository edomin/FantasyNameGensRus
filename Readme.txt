This micro-programs can generate cyrillic names for your fantasy characters.

How to use it:
1. Open generator folder then open "index.html" then choose character gender and names count then push button. Enjoy.
2. You can also grab dictionaries from "foldername/generator.js" and use it in your project. You can not use Drow dictionaries (sorry) because it are copyrated by "Wizards of the Coast" and was grab by me from "Dungeons and Dragons" texts.
